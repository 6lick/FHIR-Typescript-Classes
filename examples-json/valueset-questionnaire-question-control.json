The box can be toggled to select or de-select a given choice.  Multiple selections may be possible.</td></tr><tr><td>lookup<a name=\"lookup\"> </a></td><td>Lookup</td><td>A control where editing an item spawns a separate dialog box or screen permitting a user to navigate, filter or otherwise discover an appropriate match.  Useful for large choice sets where text matching is not an appropriate discovery mechanism.  Such screens must generally be tuned for the specific choice list structure.</td></tr><tr><td>radio-button<a name=\"radio-button\"> </a></td><td>Radio Button</td><td>A control where choices are listed with a button beside them.  The button can be toggled to select or de-select a given choice.  Selecting one item deselects all others.</td></tr><tr><td>slider<a name=\"slider\"> </a></td><td>Slider</td><td>A control where an axis is displayed between the high and low values and the control can be visually manipulated to select a value anywhere on the axis.</td></tr><tr><td>spinner<a name=\"spinner\"> </a></td><td>Spinner</td><td>A control where a list of numeric or other ordered values can be scrolled through via arrows.</td></tr><tr><td>text-box<a name=\"text-box\"> </a></td><td>Text Box</td><td>A control where a user can type in their answer freely.</td></tr></table></div>"
