It covers the ingredients and the packaging for a medication.</td></tr><tr><td>MedicationAdministration<a name=\"MedicationAdministration\"> </a></td><td>MedicationAdministration</td><td>Describes the event of a patient consuming or otherwise being administered a medication.  This may be as simple as swallowing a tablet or it may be a long running infusion.  Related resources tie this event to the authorizing prescription, and the specific encounter between patient and health care practitioner.</td></tr><tr><td>MedicationDispense<a name=\"MedicationDispense\"> </a></td><td>MedicationDispense</td><td>Indicates that a medication product is to be or has been dispensed for a named person/patient.  This includes a description of the medication product (supply) provided and the instructions for administering the medication.  The medication dispense is the result of a pharmacy system responding to a medication order.</td></tr><tr><td>MedicationOrder<a name=\"MedicationOrder\"> </a></td><td>MedicationOrder</td><td>An order for both supply of the medication and the instructions for administration of the medication to a patient.

A MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the medication now, or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The medication information may come from e.g. the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains \r\rThe primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not missing detailed information.</td></tr><tr><td>MessageHeader<a name=\"MessageHeader\"> </a></td><td>MessageHeader</td><td>The header for a message exchange that is either requesting or responding to an action.  The reference(s) that are the subject of the action as well as other information related to the action are typically transmitted in a bundle in which the MessageHeader resource instance is the first resource in the bundle.</td></tr><tr><td>NamingSystem<a name=\"NamingSystem\"> </a></td><td>NamingSystem</td><td>A curated namespace that issues unique symbols within that namespace for the identification of concepts, people, devices, etc.  Represents a &quot;System&quot; used within the Identifier and Coding data types.</td></tr><tr><td>NutritionOrder<a name=\"NutritionOrder\"> </a></td><td>NutritionOrder</td><td>A request to supply a diet, formula feeding (enteral) or oral nutritional supplement to a patient/resident.</td></tr><tr><td>Observation<a name=\"Observation\"> </a></td><td>Observation</td><td>Measurements and simple assertions made about a patient, device or other subject.</td></tr><tr><td>OperationDefinition<a name=\"OperationDefinition\"> </a></td><td>OperationDefinition</td><td>A formal computable definition of an operation (on the RESTful interface) or a named query (using the search interaction).</td></tr><tr><td>OperationOutcome<a name=\"OperationOutcome\"> </a></td><td>OperationOutcome</td><td>A collection of error, warning or information messages that result from a system action.</td></tr><tr><td>Order<a name=\"Order\"> </a></td><td>Order</td><td>A request to perform an action.</td></tr><tr><td>OrderResponse<a name=\"OrderResponse\"> </a></td><td>OrderResponse</td><td>A response to an order.</td></tr><tr><td>Organization<a name=\"Organization\"> </a></td><td>Organization</td><td>A formally or informally recognized grouping of people or organizations formed for the purpose of achieving some form of collective action.
