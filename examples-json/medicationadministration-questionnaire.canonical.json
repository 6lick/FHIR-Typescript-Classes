Currently we do not specify a default of '1' in the denominator, but this is being discussed.  Other examples:  200 mcg/min or 200 mcg/1 minute; 1 liter/8 hours. If the rate changes over time, and you want to capture this in MedicationAdministration, then each change should be captured as a distinct MedicationAdministration, with a specific MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate, and the date time when the rate change occurred. Typically, the MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate element is not used to convey an average rate."}],"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]","question":[{"group":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://www.healthintersections.com.au/fhir/Profile/metadata#type","valueString":"Ratio"}],"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Ratio","question":[{"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Ratio.numerator","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"numerator:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Ratio.denominator","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"denominator:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Ratio.units","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"units:","type":"string"}],"text":"Ratio"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://www.healthintersections.com.au/fhir/Profile/metadata#type","valueString":"Range"}],"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Range","question":[{"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Range.low","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"low:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Range.high","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"high:","type":"decimal"},{"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._Range.units","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"units:","type":"string"}],"text":"Range"}],"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage.rate[x]._type","options":{"reference":"#vs6"},"repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"type","type":"choice"}],"repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Dose quantity per unit of time"}],"linkId":"MedicationAdministration.dosage","repeats":false,"required":false,"title":"Details of how medication was taken"}],"linkId":"MedicationAdministration","repeats":true,"required":false,"title":"Administration of medication to a patient"},"id":"qs1","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986"}],"publisher":"Health Level Seven International (Pharmacy)","resourceType":"Questionnaire","status":"draft"}
